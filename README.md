#Cyber-Knights

This is a 2D, 2-Player fighting game in which 2 displaced knights face off against each other in the future. Big thanks to all the amazing work up on itch.io and to Chris Courses! This is also a continuing project for me. I hope to soon add in some additional buttons for better functionality, mobile accessibility, and an AI that controls Player 2.

Thanks for checking out Cyber-Knights!

Controls:

P1 | W - Jump, A - Move Right, D - Move Left, E - Hit.
