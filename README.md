#Cyber-Knights

This is a 2D, 2-Player fighting game in which 2 displaced knights face off against each other in the future. Big thanks to all the amazing work up on itch.io and to Chris Courses! This is also a continuing project for me. I hope to soon add in some addition buttons for better functionality, mobile accessibility, and an AI to control player 2.

Thanks for checking out Cyber-Knights!
